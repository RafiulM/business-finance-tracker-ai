## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business owner, I want to easily track my financial transactions through natural language conversations with an AI assistant, so I can maintain accurate financial records without manual data entry effort and gain insights about my business financial health.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into the system, **When** I type "I spent $50 on office supplies at Staples today", **Then** the system records an expense transaction for $50 categorized as office supplies
2. **Given** I have recorded multiple transactions, **When** I view my dashboard, **Then** I see visual summaries of my income, expenses, and current financial position
3. **Given** the AI misinterprets a transaction, **When** I correct the categorization, **Then** the system updates the record and learns from the correction

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI cannot understand the user's natural language input?
- How does system handle duplicate or similar transactions?
- What happens when AI service is unavailable?
- How does system handle foreign currency transactions?
- What happens when users provide incomplete financial information?
