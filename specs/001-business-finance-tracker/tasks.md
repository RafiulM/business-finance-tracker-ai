# Tasks: Business Finance Tracker with AI Assistant

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-business-finance-tracker/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Follow TDD: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement
- Commit after each task completion
- Each task specifies exact file path
- No task modifies the same file as another [P] task
- Verify all tests fail before implementing corresponding features
- Run full test suite after each implementation phase

## Critical Success Factors
1. **Test-First Development**: Never implement before tests are written and failing
2. **AI Integration**: Ensure fallback mechanisms and caching are robust
3. **Financial Accuracy**: All monetary calculations use integers (cents)
4. **Security**: Proper authentication, validation, and audit trails
5. **Performance**: Meet response time targets for AI processing and dashboard loading
6. **Constitutional Compliance**: Ensure all principles from the constitution are followed

## Validation Checklist
