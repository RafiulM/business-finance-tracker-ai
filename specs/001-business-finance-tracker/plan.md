# Implementation Plan: Business Finance Tracker with AI Assistant

**Branch**: `001-business-finance-tracker` | **Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-business-finance-tracker/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
AI-powered business finance tracker that allows natural language transaction input, automatic categorization via GPT-4o, and provides financial insights through an interactive dashboard. The system processes financial data through a secure, audit-ready architecture with comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ (Next.js 15)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth, PostgreSQL, OpenAI GPT-4o API
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for structured financial data
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser-based)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms transaction processing, <2s dashboard load, support 1000+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: Financial data encryption at rest, immutable audit trail, GDPR compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Support small to medium businesses (1-100 employees, 10K-100K transactions/month)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
✅ **AI-Powered User Experience**: Natural language transaction processing with GPT-4o integration
✅ **Data-First Architecture**: PostgreSQL with immutable audit trail and structured schema
✅ **Financial Security & Privacy**: Better Auth, encryption at rest, role-based access
✅ **Insight Generation**: Dashboard with real-time metrics and AI-generated recommendations
✅ **Test-First Development**: TDD approach for all financial logic and business rules

### Domain-Specific Requirements
✅ **Data Security**: Integer-based monetary values (cents), encrypted sensitive data
✅ **AI Integration**: Fallback mechanisms, response caching, user override capabilities
✅ **Financial Compliance**: Basic accounting principles, audit trails, standard reporting formats
✅ **Development Workflow**: Code reviews, performance monitoring, security gates

**Structure Decision**: Web application using Next.js 15 app router with integrated frontend and backend. Database layer with Drizzle ORM, AI integration in lib/ai/, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL schema creation and Drizzle configuration
2. **Authentication System**: Better Auth integration and user management
3. **Core Models**: Transaction, Category, User entities with validation
4. **AI Integration**: OpenAI client setup and transaction processing
5. **API Endpoints**: RESTful API implementation following contracts
6. **Frontend Components**: React components for financial interface
7. **Dashboard Analytics**: Data aggregation and visualization
8. **Testing Suite**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
9. **Export Functionality**: Data export in multiple formats

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Parallel execution: Independent development tasks marked [P]

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
