# Business Finance Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Powered User Experience
Every financial interaction MUST be processed through an AI assistant interface. Users provide natural language input for expenses, income, and assets; AI extracts, categorizes, and validates data; Conversational interface reduces friction and provides immediate feedback.

### II. Data-First Architecture
All financial data MUST be structured, immutable, and audit-ready. Transaction records cannot be deleted (only soft-deleted with audit trail); All data changes must log who, what, when, and why; Database schema must support complex financial queries and reporting.

### III. Financial Security & Privacy
Financial data security is NON-NEGOTIABLE. All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest; User authentication via Better Auth with secure sessions; Data access must be role-based and logged; No third-party data sharing without explicit consent.

### IV. Insight Generation
Raw data must transform into actionable business insights. Dashboard must provide real-time financial health metrics; AI should generate spending patterns, forecasts, and recommendations; Visual reports must be comprehensive yet easy to understand.

### V. Test-First Development
TDD is mandatory for all financial logic. Tests must validate data accuracy, security boundaries, and business rules; Integration tests must cover database operations and AI interactions; All tests must pass before any deployment.

## Data Security & Privacy

Financial data requires enterprise-grade protection. All monetary values stored as integers (cents) to prevent floating-point errors; Personal and business financial data must be logically separated; Regular security audits and penetration testing required; Data retention policies must comply with financial regulations.

## AI Integration

GPT-4o integration must enhance, not replace, human financial oversight. AI must explain its reasoning for categorization decisions; Users can override AI suggestions with manual entry; AI responses must be cached to control API costs; Fallback mechanisms must exist when AI services are unavailable.

## Financial Compliance

The system must support basic accounting principles and audit requirements. Double-entry bookkeeping principles where applicable; Clear categorization of business vs personal expenses; Tax-relevant data must be tagged and easily exportable; System must generate standard financial reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).

## Development Workflow

Quality gates ensure financial reliability and security. All code changes require peer review; Database schema changes must backward compatible; Security review required for authentication and data handling changes; Performance monitoring must detect regression in query response times.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require documentation, team approval, and migration plan; All PRs and reviews must verify constitutional compliance; Architectural complexity must be justified with business value; Use project README.md for runtime development guidance.
